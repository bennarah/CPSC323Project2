You are allowed to write your project in C/C++/Java/Python etc. but you ARE NOT allowed
touse Yacc, Bison, or any other items similar that assists in the creation of compilers.
Given the following CFG and the parsing table, write a program to trace input
stringsover the alphabet { i, +, - , *, / ), ( } and ending with $.
1. Given the CFG and the Predictive Parsing table below:
â€¢ [60 points] Write a program to trace an input string given by the user. Save it as
Prog1 and upload it in canvas (either the zip file or GitHub link). Test your
programwith the following 3 input strings:
(1) (a +a)*a$
